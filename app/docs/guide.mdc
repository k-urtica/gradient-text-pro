#### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
❓ **Q. What kind of websites can I use this for?**
A. You can use gradient text for any text element—headlines, logos, buttons, navigation, banners, and more. It's especially effective for creating eye-catching titles and branding elements.

💻 **Q. What format is the generated code?**
A. The output is standard CSS with gradient properties, available in both traditional HEX format and modern OKLCH color space. OKLCH provides smoother, more natural gradients with better perceptual uniformity. The code includes all necessary properties for cross-browser compatibility.

🖼️ **Q. What image formats are supported for export?**
A. You can export your gradient text as PNG (best for general use), WebP (smaller file size with good quality), or SVG (vector format, scalable). Each format also supports multiple scale options (1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x) for different display densities and use cases.

🎨 **Q. What's the difference between HEX and OKLCH color formats?**
A. HEX is the classic format that's widely supported and familiar to most developers. OKLCH is a modern color space that provides more natural gradient transitions, better color uniformity, and smoother blending. Choose HEX for maximum compatibility or OKLCH for the best visual results.
